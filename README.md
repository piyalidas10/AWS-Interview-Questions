| 1   | What is a Distributed Cache? <br/><br/> Distributed caches are crucial tools for enhancing the dependability and speed of applications. By storing frequently accessed data across several servers and closer to the point of demand, distributed caches lower latency and decrease the strain on backend systems. 
| 2   | What is the use of Redis in AWS? <br/><br/> Redis improves the performance of AI and data science workloads on AWS by providing fast, in-memory data storage and processing. This reduces latency and accelerates the execution of complex algorithms and data retrieval operations.
| 3   | What is Redis? <br/><br/> Redis is the world's fastest in-memory database. It provides cloud and on-prem solutions for caching, vector search, and NoSQL databases that seamlessly fit into any tech stackâ€”making it simple for digital customers to build, scale, and deploy the fast apps our world runs on. Examples : 1. Storing Idempotency key
| 4   | How many databases? <br/><br/> 1. Dynamo DB 2. Reddis (short time storing like Idempotency keys)
| 5   | Why is Redis not used as a database? <br/><br/> Frequent data updates and the potential for data loss during failures make Redis less suitable for scenarios requiring the highest level of data durability.
| 6   | Is Kafka used for Live Streaming? <br/><br/> Apache Kafka is a distributed data store optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time. Streaming data is data that is continuously generated by thousands of data sources, which typically send the data records in simultaneously.
| 7   | Does Netflix use Kafka? <br/><br/> Yes, Netflix uses Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a widely-used, high-throughput distributed messaging system designed for real-time data streaming. Netflix leverages Kafka as a critical component of its big data and real-time analytics infrastructure.
| 8   | What is Kafka best used for? <br/><br/> Kafka is a stream processing system used for messaging, website activity tracking, metrics collection and monitoring, logging, event sourcing, commit logs, and real-time analytics.
| 9   | What is a real life example of Kafka? <br/><br/> Smart cities leverage Kafka to ingest sensor data from traffic lights, environmental sensors, and public transportation systems. This data is used for traffic management, pollution monitoring, and optimizing city services.
