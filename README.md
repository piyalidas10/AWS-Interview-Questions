| 1   | What is a Distributed Cache? <br/><br/> Distributed caches are crucial tools for enhancing the dependability and speed of applications. By storing frequently accessed data across several servers and closer to the point of demand, distributed caches lower latency and decrease the strain on backend systems. 
| 2   | What is the use of Redis in AWS? <br/><br/> Redis improves the performance of AI and data science workloads on AWS by providing fast, in-memory data storage and processing. This reduces latency and accelerates the execution of complex algorithms and data retrieval operations.
| 3   | What is Redis? <br/><br/> Redis is the world's fastest in-memory database. It provides cloud and on-prem solutions for caching, vector search, and NoSQL databases that seamlessly fit into any tech stackâ€”making it simple for digital customers to build, scale, and deploy the fast apps our world runs on. Examples : 1. Storing Idempotency key
| 4   | How many databases? <br/><br/> 1. Dynamo DB 2. Reddis (short time storing like Idempotency keys)
| 5   | Why is Redis not used as a database? <br/><br/> Frequent data updates and the potential for data loss during failures make Redis less suitable for scenarios requiring the highest level of data durability.
