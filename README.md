| 1   | What is a Distributed Cache? <br/><br/> Distributed caches are crucial tools for enhancing the dependability and speed of applications. By storing frequently accessed data across several servers and closer to the point of demand, distributed caches lower latency and decrease the strain on backend systems. 
| 2   | What is the use of Redis in AWS? <br/><br/> Redis improves the performance of AI and data science workloads on AWS by providing fast, in-memory data storage and processing. This reduces latency and accelerates the execution of complex algorithms and data retrieval operations.
| 3   | What is Redis? <br/><br/> Redis is the world's fastest in-memory database. It provides cloud and on-prem solutions for caching, vector search, and NoSQL databases that seamlessly fit into any tech stack—making it simple for digital customers to build, scale, and deploy the fast apps our world runs on. Examples : 1. Storing Idempotency key
| 4   | How many databases? <br/><br/> 1. Dynamo DB 2. Reddis (short time storing like Idempotency keys)
| 5   | Why is Redis not used as a database? <br/><br/> Frequent data updates and the potential for data loss during failures make Redis less suitable for scenarios requiring the highest level of data durability.
| 6   | Is Kafka used for Live Streaming? <br/><br/> Apache Kafka is a distributed data store optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time. Streaming data is data that is continuously generated by thousands of data sources, which typically send the data records in simultaneously.
| 7   | Does Netflix use Kafka? <br/><br/> Yes, Netflix uses Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a widely-used, high-throughput distributed messaging system designed for real-time data streaming. Netflix leverages Kafka as a critical component of its big data and real-time analytics infrastructure.
| 8   | What is Kafka best used for? <br/><br/> Kafka is a stream processing system used for messaging, website activity tracking, metrics collection and monitoring, logging, event sourcing, commit logs, and real-time analytics.
| 9   | What is a real life example of Kafka? <br/><br/> Smart cities leverage Kafka to ingest sensor data from traffic lights, environmental sensors, and public transportation systems. This data is used for traffic management, pollution monitoring, and optimizing city services.
| 10  | S3(Simple Storage Service) Bucket <br/><br/> AWS S3(Simple Storage Service) is a storage-as-a-service platform provided by Amazon. S3 offers various types of storage classes such as Standard, Standard IA, Intelligent, Reduced Redundancy, and Glacier. Amazon S3 stores the data inside a bucket in the form of an object. The object inside the S3 bucket can be accessed, versioned, and deleted as per requirement. AWS S3 provides high performance and low latency for data access
| 11  | IAM (Identity Access Management) <br/><br/> Identity and access management (IAM) is a security discipline that enables organizations to manage digital identities and control user access to critical information and systems. The 4 four major components of identity Access Management are Identity, Authentication, Authorization, Auditing.
| 12  | Amazon API Gateway <br/><br/> The Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service that allows users to create, publish, secure, maintain and monitor APIs at any scale.
| 13  | Lambda <br/><br/> An Amazon serverless computing system that runs code and automatically manages the underlying computing resources like (EC2). It lets a person automatically run code in response to many types of events, such as HTTP requests from the Amazon API gateway, table updates in Amazon DynamoDB, and state transitions.
| 14  | Break glass permission <br/><br/> break glass permission like admin permission (1 hour stay) — gives permission to CRUD operations for all resources step functions same like break glass
| 15  | CloudFront Distribution <br/><br/> CloudFront is an example of Content Delivery Network (CDN). This will pull the static files from our S3 bucket and distribute them across a network of data centers (edge locations) around the globe. When a user accesses our app, they’ll be served from the nearest edge location, ensuring minimal latency.
| 16  | Invalidate CloudFront Cache <br/><br/> allows you to remove cached content from the CDN so that new content can be delivered to users. Whenever there is a change, we want our users to see the latest updates as quickly as possible. For this particular reason, we would invalidate the content from CloudFront.
| 17  | Multitenant - shared resources
| 18  | ARN (Amazon Resource Name) <br/><br/> An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is a string that uniquely identifies an AWS resource, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, accounts, Lambda functions, and so forth. Resources are unique to each service. role, policy
| 19  | Lambda Authorizer <br/><br/> Lambda Authorizer is being used with API Gateway to authorize authentication token. Use a Lambda authorizer to implement a custom authorization scheme. Your scheme can use request parameters to determine the caller’s identity or use a bearer token authentication strategy such as OAuth or SAML.
| 20  | CloudWatch <br/><br/> A service used for monitoring and observing Resources (Performance, Health of the application, Monitors the resource) in real-time. Follow the steps (api gateway -> lamda -> monitor -> log) to check logs. It contains log of api. You can create metric and composite alarms in Amazon CloudWatch.
| 21  | CloudTrail <br/><br/> A service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It continuously logs and monitors the activities and actions across your AWS account.
| 22  | SNS <br/><br/> push notification (system administrators will get notification)
| 23  | Xray <br/><br/> Read time of services how much time taken. Check which services are most accessed or have highest latency.
| 24  | Data Lake <br/><br/> A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can run data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and high-performance computing (HPC) applications to unlock the value of your data. With an Amazon S3 data lake, users in Salesforce’s organization can discover, access, and analyze all their data, regardless of where it lives, in a secure and governed way.
| 25  | DynamoDB <br/><br/> Serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database with single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. As a serverless database, you only pay for what you use.
| 26  | Glacier <br/><br/> AWS Glacier, is the backup and archival storage provided by AWS. It is an extremely low-cost, long-term, durable, secure storage service that is ideal for backups and archival needs.
| 27  | Amazon EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) <br/><br/> allows the user to configure their instances as per their requirements i.e. allocate the RAM, ROM, and storage according to the need of the current task. EC2 is an virtual machine where you can deploy the web applications. EC2 belongs to Infrastructure as a service(IAAS) where the underlaying infrastructure is taken care by AWS.
| 28  | AWS Messaging services <br/><br/> Two of their most famous services are Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
| 29  | S3 Bucket for CloudFront Access Logs <br/><br/> Monitoring and logging are crucial for any application. We’ll set up a separate S3 bucket dedicated to storing CloudFront’s access logs. These logs provide detailed records about every user request that CloudFront receives. By analyzing these logs, you can gain insights into user behavior, troubleshoot issues, and even detect potential security threats.
| 30  | Lightstreamer vs Appsync <br/><br/>
